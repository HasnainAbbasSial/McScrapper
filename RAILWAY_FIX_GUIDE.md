# Railway Deployment Fix Guide

## Problem: "Train has not arrived at the station" Error

This error means Railway can't connect to your app. I've created fixes for this.

## New Files Created:
- `startup.py` - Better way to start your app on Railway
- Updated `Procfile` - Simplified startup command  
- Updated `railway.json` - Added health check
- Added `/health` route in your app for Railway to check if it's running

## Quick Fix Steps:

### Step 1: Update Your Railway Settings
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on "Deploy" tab on the left
3. Change the "Custom Start Command" to: `python startup.py`
4. In "Healthcheck Path" add: `/health`
5. Click "Deploy" to redeploy

### Step 2: Add Environment Variable
1. Go to "Variables" tab in Railway
2. Add new variable:
   - Name: `PORT`
   - Value: `5000`
3. Click "Add"

### Step 3: Check Logs
1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Check the logs - you should see: "Starting server on port 5000"

## Alternative Method - Upload New Files:

If the above doesn't work, download your updated project:

1. In Replit → Files → Download as zip
2. Extract and rename `deploy_requirements.txt` to `requirements.txt`
3. Upload to your GitHub repository (replace old files)
4. Railway will auto-redeploy

## Expected Results:
- Your app should start successfully
- The URL `https://mcscrap.up.railway.app` should work
- You should see the login page
- Health check at `https://mcscrap.up.railway.app/health` should return "healthy"

The main fix is using `python startup.py` instead of gunicorn, which works better with Flask-SocketIO on Railway.
